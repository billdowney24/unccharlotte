### Brief

In this exercise, you'll begin to create a .Net MVC application for a coffee shop.

### Instructions

- Make a directory named `charbucks`

- Inside that directory, create a .Net MVC application.

  `dotnet new mvc`

- Create a `CoffeesController`

- Inside of your `CoffeesController`, create a method that responds to the route `Index`. Rather than returning a `View`, simply return a string which says: "Coffees Index route."

- Add similar `About` and `Contact` routes.

- Run your app when you finish. Are the URLs case sensitive?
